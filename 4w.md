# The NeuralNine Python Self-Study Curriculum (4 Weeks)

This little self-study Python curriculum shall help you to stay structured and organized while learning Python concepts from beginner to advanced.

## Little Side-Note

The curriculum is meant to be worked through in four weeks (considering the recommended daily time investment, which you will find in the respective week). However, it is understandable if some programmers need more time than that, to digest this amount of knowledge. So don't judge yourself, if you feel overwhelmed with the four week time frame. Likewise, it is understandable that some people will understands concept way faster and will be able to finish the whole curriculum in a single week. If you belong to those people, don't let the recommended time frame limit you.

## Week One - Beginner Level (1-3 Hours / Day)

## Week Four - Project Week (2-4 Hours / Day)

In this final week, your goal is to complete one Python project every single day. I recommend you to choose projects of a realistic size, so that you don't spend more than 2-4 hours every day on implementing it (unless you purposely want to).

You will have to choose your own projects, but here are some links that might inspire you.

I hope this curriculum helps you to find a structured way to learn Python. If you guys like it and the feedback is positive, I will definitely do another curriculum for learning data science, machine learning, finance, cyber security etc.
